## 👋 Hi, I’m Youana

I'm an aspiring Data Scientist passionate about bringing the power data holds into the real-world, helping to make informed decisions, particularly to the healthcare and business domains.

As an EMT, I've seen firsthand the weaknesses of the healthcare system, and as a Data Scientist, I've seen the unimaginable impact data has, and I believe with my understanding and knowledge of both, I can help make great impacts in healthcare applications.
